    "**AMIA** is a Python toolkit built on a Unix OS to analyse the impact of residue variations on protein structures in both their static and dynamic conformations. This tools aims to provide an accelerated framework to perform the complex task of prioritizing poential resistance residue variations that potentially impact treatment regimens. "
